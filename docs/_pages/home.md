Hi,

My name is Omar Garrido Martin, student of the Computer Vision Master in university Rey Juan Carlos in Madrid, Spain.

The goal of this Master's thesis is to implement a SLAM algorithm suitable for drones using only depth information. The sensor for adquisition of the depth information used is Realsense D435 camera.
check the project logbook to know everything about this project.

The tutors of the project are:

- [Jose Maria Ca√±as](https://gsyc.urjc.es/jmplaza/)
