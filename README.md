# SD-SLAM
A new version of SD-SLAM has been developed with the integration of DIFODO algorithm. The entire development can be found on the [blog](https://roboticslaburjc.github.io/2019-tfm-omar-garrido/)

# Locations
The development of several pieces of code were developed during this Master Thesis. Some are found within this repository and the main piece, SD-SLAM is on another repo. The code is:
- SD-SLAM
- Rosify Difodo
- odometry_evaluation_file_creator
